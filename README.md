## Introduction

The Secure Locker project aims to develop a secure locker system utilizing RFID technology for access control and blockchain for tracking. This project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software to create a reliable and secure storage solution.

## Project Components

This repository includes the following components:

1. **Arduino Code**: The code that runs on the Arduino to control the RFID reader and manage locker operations.
2. **Presentation (PPT)**: A PowerPoint presentation detailing the project's objectives, implementation, and results.
3. **Poster**: A visual summary of the project, showcasing key features and the overall design.
4. **Report**: A comprehensive report covering the project from inception to completion, including background research, design decisions, implementation details, and conclusions.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running on your machine, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- Basic knowledge of Arduino and RFID technology
- Familiarity with blockchain concepts

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Ranjan1234/Secure-Locker-RFID-Enabled-Locker-with-Blockchain-Tracking.git
   ```

2. **Open the Arduino Code**

   - Navigate to the `arduino` directory.
   - Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

3. **Upload to Arduino**

   - Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
   - Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Click on the upload button to upload the code to the Arduino board.

## Usage

Once the Arduino code is uploaded, the RFID-enabled locker system should be operational. Present an RFID tag to the reader to unlock the locker. Each transaction will be logged and tracked using blockchain technology.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the faculty and staff of RVCE College for their support and guidance throughout this project.
